What do you get when you cross an artist in a five-year and counting slump, the Rolling Stones's manager, Led Zeppelin's bassist, and the British need to always outdo those Americans? Apparently, one of the greatest psychedelic records of all time.



Unfortunately, Home and Away is sort of a great album that never was. After being completed in early 1967, Immediate Records released *Runaway '67* and *Mind Over Matter* as a lead singles to public indifference, despite critical acclaim. This lack of a public response caused the record label shelve the album entirely, with it only fully resurfacing in a 2006 release. Sadly, Del Shannon's untimely death in 1990 meant he never was able to see what I believe to be his opus released to the public.
