My biggest inspiration for this bike blog has always been [Eric Zheng's cycling blog](https://ericzheng.org/cycling/index.html), a ride report blog by a recent CMU graduate showcasing dozens of interesting rides, particularly in the Pittsburgh area. A lot of my rides have been inspired by rides I first saw on his blog, but the one that always stood out to me was the [Three-State Century](https://ericzheng.org/cycling/ohio-century.html)- a 100 mile ride to West Virginia and Ohio. 

Despite its proximity to Pennsylvania's western border, I never think of Pittsburgh as close to Ohio. Maybe it's the fact I grew up one town over from a state border myself, but I always think of West Virginia (let alone Ohio) as firmly outside Pittsburgh's neighborhood. The idea, therefore, of biking 100 miles to neighboring states and back in a single day seemed incredibly cool. I had done [one century before](../montour-trail), but something about crossing two state borders made this *feel* more impressive to my brain.

There was also a practical[^1] reason to check this route out in particular. A majority of the ride follows the [Panhandle Trail](https://panhandletrail.org/), a 29 mile rail trail stretching from the Pittsburgh suburb of Carnegie, PA to across the West Virginian border that I had wanted to explore for a while.[^2] So, with the excess of free time I was afforded as a college student on summer break, I set out for my own Tri-State Century. 

### Pennsylvania → West Virginia
I spent the first 15 miles of my trip getting to the Panhandle Trail. From CMU, I got onto the South Side Trail and, and after a brief section of highway found myself climbing Greentree Road around 450 feet to leave the valley Pittsburgh creates. The climb was definitely tough but it was early enough in the ride that I felt fine (and I don't believe there's an easy route to the trail that avoids climbs, anyways). After the climb and a subsequent downhill I bombed down at 35 miles per hour, I rode through lovely downtown Carnegie to get to the trailhead.

The trail itself starts off quite similar to the other rail trails in the Pittsburgh area: a wide gravel track surrounded by greenery and the occasional road over or under the trail. Once I crossed into Washington County, though, the trail became paved which made riding a lot quicker, which was nice. There was even one beautiful section where the trail meandered through an open field instead of a green tunnel, which was honestly one of the prettiest things I've ever seen on a bike. The day I decided to ride also happened to be sunny and slightly cooler than usual, which added to the experience even further.

Overall, my ride through the Panhandle Trail was fairly uneventful as I passed by various trail towns in the furthest extremities of Western Pennsylvania on what ended up being a suprisingly flat ride given the hills around the trail. After about twenty miles on the trail, I reached a little marker signifying where the trail crosses the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. I made sure to play John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" in my earphones as crossed into my second state.

### West Virginia → Ohio
From the West Virginia border, the Panhandle Trail continues another four miles to a trailhead in Weirton, West Virginia. The sliver of West Virginia separating Pennsylvania and Ohio is only around five miles across, but in those five miles sat a 400 foot hill before a similar drop to the Ohio River. My biking app believes the incline up the hill reached a 15% gradient at its steepest, which if true would make this the steepest climb I've ever done. 

The top of the hill housed a few small farms

### Ohio → Pennsylvania
As cool as it was to bike to Ohio, the one unfortunate thing about this route is that you have to climb over the hills of the West Virginian Panhandle twice in a 15 mile span, once for each direction. I had decided to take a slightly more direct route back that would hopefully have a slightly gentler incline, and while the way up from Ohio was easier I hadn't taken into account my steep downhill was on thick gravel! Rather than being able to speed down the hill as I had the way in, I ended up having to squeeze my breaks for dear life so my back tire wouldn't slide out from under me. Needless to say, my route back through West Virginia was less than ideal.

After what should have been 15 minutes but ended up closer to 45 due to said gravel, I reconnected with the Panhandle Trail for my return voyage. The biggest downside about out-and-back rides is that you've seen pretty much everything by the time you're halfway in. I was only 60 miles into my century ride, and was hurting considerably more than when I started on the Panhandle Trail on the way out.
