Hi!

I'm Joe McLaughlin[^1], a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science. Outside of work, I enjoy [biking](thoughts/biking/), [running](thoughts/misc/marathon/), and listening to music<!--[listening to music](thoughts/music-reviews/)-->.

Some quick links if you're in a hurry:
- [My Resume](assets/pdf/resume.pdf), for any potential employers or otherwise.
- [CMU Course Reviews](/cmu-course-reviews/), for any students currently binging these.
- [Cool Projects I've Worked On](/projects/) (Cool is a relative term).
<!-- - [My Biking Blog](), for anyone who I haven't bored to death in person about biking already. -->

Otherwise, feel free to look through the website at your own pace, that is why I made it after all!
